//! CPU P-core DVFS keep-alive for the ranked worker's ready→seed idle gap.
//!
//! # The gap
//!
//! The ranked worker runs an *untimed* warm-up proof, publishes its "ready"
//! file, then waits for the harness to write the timed 64-bit seed to stdin.
//! Across that wait every prover thread is parked in the kernel: the worker
//! main thread blocks reading the seed-pipe forwarding pipe, the seed-pipe
//! thread blocks in the real-stdin `read()` (`seed_pipe::read_line_fd`), and
//! both Rayon pools sit idle. With nothing runnable, Apple Silicon drops the
//! P-cluster into a deep idle P-state. The timed window is measured from
//! "seed written" to "proof published", so when the seed lands the first slice
//! of that window is spent ramping the clock back up from idle — a scored
//! cost. (The GPU keep-warm bridge already prevents the analogous *GPU* DVFS
//! decay; this is its CPU counterpart, which was previously unaddressed.)
//!
//! # What this does
//!
//! From the tail of the warm-up ([`keepalive_start`]) until the seed's first
//! byte is read ([`keepalive_stop`]), spawn one light spin thread per
//! performance core, each tagged `QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED` (via
//! [`crate::set_calling_thread_prover_qos`]) so the scheduler keeps it on a
//! P-core rather than an efficiency core. Each thread retires a tight loop of
//! **scalar integer** arithmetic on a private register — no SIMD, no CLMUL, no
//! memory traffic. That is enough to hold the P-cluster's DVFS clock request
//! up (the goal is to prevent a deep-idle P-state collapse, not to maximize
//! power), while drawing far less than a real prover kernel would.
//!
//! # Why it cannot change the proof
//!
//! The spin touches only a per-thread `u64` fed through `std::hint::black_box`.
//! It reads and writes **zero** proof / Fiat-Shamir / witness / commitment
//! state and shares nothing with the prover but the CPU it warms. Proof bytes
//! are therefore identical with the keep-alive on or off, by construction.
//!
//! # Handoff
//!
//! The seed-pipe thread calls [`keepalive_stop`] the instant its stdin `read()`
//! returns — before it forwards the seed byte or starts the speculative prove —
//! and the timed `prove_fast` call also calls it (idempotently) as a fallback
//! when the seed pipe is disabled. Stop signals the spin threads and joins
//! them, so the timed path never shares a core with a keep-alive thread and the
//! keep-alive never steals a cycle from real proving.
//!
//! # Safety net
//!
//! A hard `MAX_KEEPALIVE` deadline caps how long the spin can run even if
//! [`keepalive_stop`] is never reached (a caller error, or a pathologically
//! long harness gap). Past the deadline the threads exit on their own, so the
//! spin can never become an unbounded furnace and the worst case degrades back
//! to the baseline deep-idle behavior.
//!
//! Disable the whole mechanism with `FLOCK_NO_CPU_KEEPALIVE=1`. The effect is
//! Apple-Silicon-specific, so on every other target both entry points are
//! no-ops.
