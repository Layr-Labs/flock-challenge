//! Efficiency-core helper pool: barrier-free extra throughput for the
//! prover's embarrassingly parallel phases.
//!
//! The ranked benchmark sizes the main rayon pool to the performance-core
//! count (`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=10` on the M3 Max) and pins its workers to
//! `QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED`, which keeps them off the efficiency cores.
//! That leaves the M3 Max's 4 E-cores fully idle for the entire timed proof.
//!
//! Folding E-cores into the main pool is a known regression: kernels that
//! partition into one equal band per worker gate their barrier on the slowest
//! core (see `init_perf_thread_pool`'s doc comment — 8 threads beat 10 by
//! 10–20% on `pcs::commit` when the pool included E-cores). This module takes
//! the opposite shape:
//!
//! - the main pool is untouched — same width, same QoS, same kernels;
//! - a separate lazily-built pool of `hw.perflevel1.logicalcpu` threads at
//!   `QOS_CLASS_UTILITY` (the scheduler places these on E-cores while the
//!   higher-QoS main workers own the P-cores);
//! - ordinary phases hand work to it through [`run_hetero_chunks`], a shared
//!   atomic chunk queue drained by both pools. The ranked NTT-to-Merkle path
//!   instead streams finalized cache chunks through its own bounded queue so
//!   leaf hashing can overlap the transform. In both shapes an E-core owns at
//!   most one tail chunk when the main pool finishes.
//!
//! Output is byte-identical by construction: chunk `i` covers a fixed range
//! and is processed by the same function regardless of which pool claims it.
//!
//! On non-macOS or non-Apple-Silicon hosts, and whenever detection fails, the
//! helper pool is absent and the queue is drained by the main pool alone.
//! With a deliberately single-threaded main pool (`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`) the
//! queue runs inline on the calling thread and spawns nothing, preserving
//! truly serial execution.
